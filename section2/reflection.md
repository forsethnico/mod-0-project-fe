## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

In the video she discusses the fixed mindset, which basically says your capabilities are what you were born with. But with the growth mindset, you have a starting point and what you are tomorrow can be different from what you are today. I think it's easier to stay in the fixed mindset because it is what happens naturally without much notice, but the growth mindset takes observation and effort to make changes and grow. Struggling with something is the first step to being sort of ok at something. It doesn't mean you shouldn't try.

In the article, the section on seeking out challenges really resonated with me. I tend to try to do the right thing the first time, rather than make mistakes and see what breaks. I need to try making more mistakes to practice resolving those issues. And to try taking on more advanced challenges to expand my skills.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I exhibit a growth mindset by not being afraid to seek help. I have no problem asking questions or feeling dumb. I have started a lot of new personal hobbies over the years even though they have been scary.

I don't exhibit a growth mindset by not setting measurable goals and reflecting on my progress.  I don't naturally fall into daily routines or very structured time and goals. I also tend to avoid challenges at times and like to stick to things that work instead of learning what breaks.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It was a little uncomfortable since I had to try to remember all the steps and syntax, but it made me go back and review things from Section 1 and our notes. I think it is good to not have everything laid out since we are forced to try to remember things rather than follow them as written out in the prompts. I also had to Google a few things that I didn't know or find them in our notes or other resources.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

* A Conditional statement is based on an if/then/else. If some condition is met, a block of code will execute. Else when a different condition is met, then a different set of code will execute. Finally, when none of those conditions are met, the code will do something else or just skip that step.

* A daily life conditional is my gas tank level. If my gas tank is above one quarter full I drive to work, else if my gas tank is less than one quarter full but more than empty I go get gas then to go work. Else if empty or lower, I stay home and call in sick. :P

* An example in a web application is relating to shipping cost in your checkout cart. You enter your zip code. If your zip code is in Alaska, add $100 to shipping cost. Else if your zip code is in the US cart and your cart total is less than $75, add $15 shipping to your subtotal before final checkout. Else if your zip code is in the US and your subtotal is greater than or equal to $75, shipping is free (proceed to checkout as is). Else if your zip code is anything other than US and Alaska, say we don't ship to you!

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

The program will run through each part of the if statement (start with if and then add multiple subsequent 'else if' conditions) until it finds one condition that meets and evaluates to true then runs that code. For example, it may not run the rest of the code block if the first condition is met. When any of the 'if' or 'else if' conditions do not evaluate to true it will run the 'else' code or skip the step.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

Use logical operators 'and' (&&) to check if two conditions have been met. Can use 'or' (||) to see if one of the two conditions has been met.  

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

* How do you determine which conditions should be the IF vs the ELSE IF conditions? Sometimes I can't figure out which should be in which order and how to combine multiple comparisons on which lines. 

* Do the less than or greater than symbols have a strict comparison or not? will they disregard data type?
