## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
It started to feel more comfortable. I had to look back at some previous lessons and sections for help with the syntax and where to put the ( or } and things like that, but it is starting to feel more familiar. I think I need to be better at using the MDN more, as opposed to just googling something.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Recreation.gov has a list of campsites in your area that are available to book.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is an action or function that modifies an array. For example, can either add or remove elements.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of a loop is to have the computer do repetitive tasks that you don't need to and with shorter amounts of code.
We would use a loop in conjunction with an array to step through each element of the array and execute some code on it vs without an array you would just be doing a task until some condition or counter is met, like doing a math function.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
You have a fresh batch of 12 cookies, like an array. Your task is to try each cookie. So you create a loop to pick up each cookie, taste it, and put it back down until you have tasted all 12 cookies or until you get tummy ache.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
Mostly just curious on how to execute more complicated versions of array loops using different array methods inside of them.
